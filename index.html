                <h1>Shadow of War Builds</h1>
                <p>
                    When talking about builds for Shadow of War, I take 3 factors into consideration. The first factor I take into consideration is power. This is how much pure damage you can do with the build. The second factor I take into consideration is chaos. This is how devastating the build is to every entity in play, including you. The last factor I take into consideration is specialty. This is how good the build is in specific situations like 1v1 against captains or wave clearing.
                </p>

                <H2>Poison</H2>
                <p>
                    The Poison build focuses on enhancing the effect of the poison condition. Poison as a status condition is already a good ability as it deals good starting damage and causes enemies to pause their attacks to throw up which spreads the effect. The build utilizes the Dark legendary set to increase the damage over time effect of poison to enemies as well as make the condition last longer. The Dark Legendary set gear bonus makes poison damage dealt to enemies give you Might which you can use for special attacks that can be imbued with poison. The set also gives the chance that enemy grunts will trigger poison explosions, however if you are not immune to poison then those explosions will knock you down and break the flow of combat.

                <p>
                    The Marauder DPS build is a siege focus build that excels in large fights. The build focuses on having enemy grunts drop money upon their deaths and using the Marauder legendary set bonus to gain a stacking 2% damage bonus per coin collected for 20 seconds. In large scale combat you and your allies are always killing enemy grunts which adds to the damage potential of this build. This build is weaker in 1 vs 1 combat with enemy captains. It also utilized the Outlaw Legendary set to cause random effects on attacks as well as increased damage to enraged enemies. The bonus damage to enraged enemies can cause you to defeat enemy captains in only a few hits with the money based bonus damage stacked high enough.

                <H2>Necromancy</H2>
                <p>
                    The Necromancy build focuses on creating unkillable undead soldiers to march against your enemies. By stacking damage reduction bonuses and undead creation abilities you are left with an ever increasing undead horde. By utilizing the Legendary Mystic gear bonus, items from the Legendary Ringwraith set, and the Darkbanner epic rune, your undead allies take over 95% less damage. The Legendary Ringwraith set grants you many chances for you to gain undead allies without even having to use your Raise Dead ability. This build is heavily focused on large scale combat such as sieges. Although you can summon undead due to the Ringwraith set bonus, without corpses nearby this build is useless in a 1 vs 1 scenario.

                <p>
                    While the Fire build is also focused on one of the gameâ€™s base status conditions, it is significantly different from the previous Poison build. While the Poison build enhances the poison condition to do more damage, the Fire build focuses on setting yourself on fire to make you stronger and cause the most chaos as possible. The main aspect of the Build is 4 specific pieces of gear from the Warmonger Legendary set. The gear from the warmonger set makes it so that being on fire will heal the main character. The gear will also cause your stealth attacks and ranged attacks to set enemies of fire. The gear set bonus grants you more healing as well as causing bursts of flame to emit from the character while on fire.

                    This endgame build focuses on getting the player in and out of their empowered Ringwraith mode which generates Might, enhances attack damage, and raises undead when ended. The core part of this build is not actually the Legendary gear, but the Epic sword Wrathgiver which gives Wrath on an execution. Combine this ability with a non-elemental Elven Light, you will gain this Wrath per enemy hit by the AOE. You can use the Might generated by the Ringwraith ability to use Elven Light to gain Wrath faster than Ringwraith consumes it. Combining this with the Bright Lord set depletes Wrath faster, but increases its gain. This allows you to get out of the ability and back in almost immediately which floods the battlefield with bursts of enhanced undead allies.

            <p>
                Hi, My name is Kareem (he/him). I want to make games because I enjoy the process of designing and refining systems. I find making games to have enjoyable elements while also being a thought provoking and interesting challenge. I like games that give people a window to different experiences, realistic or otherwise. I also enjoy games with measurable systems that can be explored and used in fun ways. Games are important because they are interesting and fun (depending on the game) mediums to gain new experiences. These experiences can be from watching the story of a game, learning something new (including game specific systems), and connecting with others. Games could become an effective medium to educate people. They can be used to teach core subjects to students, prevalent information to the masses, and even socio-emotional skills to a great many people.
