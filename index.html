        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p1>
            Hi, My name is Kareem (he/him). I want to make games because I enjoy the process of designing and refining systems. I find making games to have enjoyable elements while also being a thought provoking and interesting challenge. I like games that give people a window to different experiences, realistic or otherwise. I also enjoy games with measurable systems that can be explored and used in fun ways. Games are important because they are interesting and fun (depending on the game) mediums to gain new experiences. These experiences can be from watching the story of a game, learning something new (including game specific systems), and connecting with others. Games could become an effective medium to educate people. They can be used to teach core subjects to students, prevalent information to the masses, and even socio-emotional skills to a great many people.

        <h2>Shadow of War Builds</h2>
        <h3>What factors I take into concideration</h3>
        <P1>
            When talking about builds for Shadow of war I take 3 factors into concideration. The first factor I take into concideration is power. This is how much pure damage you can do with the build. The second factor I take into concideration is chaos. This is how devistating the build is to every entity in play, including you. The last factor I take into concideration is specialty. This is how good the build is in specific situations like 1v1 against captains or wave clearing.
        </P1><br>

        <div class="box">
            <h4>Power = Damage</h4>
            <h4>Chaos = Risk</h4>
            <h4>Specialty = Neish use</h4>
        </div>
